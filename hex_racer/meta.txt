  (info, "When dealing with a lot of bits, binary can become hard to read. Hexadecimal (base 16) represents each combination of 4 bits as its own character:
[code]
0 [OFF][OFF][OFF][OFF]
1 [OFF][OFF][OFF][ON]
2 [OFF][OFF][ON][OFF]
3 [OFF][OFF][ON][ON]
4 [OFF][ON][OFF][OFF]
5 [OFF][ON][OFF][ON]
6 [OFF][ON][ON][OFF]
7 [OFF][ON][ON][ON]
8 [ON][OFF][OFF][OFF]
9 [ON][OFF][OFF][ON]
A [ON][OFF][ON][OFF]
B [ON][OFF][ON][ON]
C [ON][ON][OFF][OFF]
D [ON][ON][OFF][ON]
E [ON][ON][ON][OFF]
F [ON][ON][ON][ON]
[/code]

As an example where hexadecimal is much clearer, lets compare the representation of the largest 16 bit number:
[code]
Binary:      1111111111111111
Decimal:     65535
Hexadecimal: FFFF
[/code]

It is not easy to tell if the binary is missing a digit or if the decimal number is off by 1, the hexadecimal on the other hand is immediately clear (once you get used to the representation at least)."),

You must beat level 3 to pass.
